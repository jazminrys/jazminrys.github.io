      <p>Hello, I’m <strong>Jazmin Reyes</strong>.</p>

      <p>I grew up in the Bay Area and chose Boston University to pursue my studies in Data Science while experiencing a new environment. I began my academic journey at BU’s College of General Studies, which included the opportunity to study abroad in London. During my time there, I examined how rhetoric and politics influenced World War II and visited significant historical sites that enhanced my understanding of the subject.</p>

      <p>My studies at CGS culminated in a capstone project where I collaborated with a team of six to develop a comprehensive policy proposal focused on improving maternity care in Mississippi.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 2024, I reconnected with Science Accelerating Girls Engagement with STEM (SAGE), a program I participated in during high school, and completed an internship at Stanford’s Linear Accelerator Center National Laboratory. This experience provided invaluable exposure to cutting-edge technology and involved direct collaboration with physicists. I was fortunate to be mentored by mechanical engineer Sharon Perez and to participate in Miss CEO training with Nita Singh Kaushal, where I learned strategies for leveraging professional opportunities.</p>

      <p>In my junior year, I explored my interest in walkable cities through BU’s Cross Country Challenge course, working with the client Cycle to Science to add a destination to their website.</p>

      <p>More recently, reading Atul Gawande’s <em>Being Mortal</em> deepened my awareness of America’s changing demographics and inspired my interest in AgeTech. This summer, I am interning at Jamiez, a startup in Silicon Valley focused on bridging the care gap through innovative services. I am excited to contribute my expertise and passion for ethical data collection and developing technology tailored for older adults.</p>
