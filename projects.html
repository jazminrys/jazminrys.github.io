      <h2>Santa Clara County Interactive Map</h2>
      <p>
        This is an interactive map I created for an AgeTech startup based in Silicon Valley.
        It visualizes median income and the percentage of residents over age 65 across neighborhoods in Santa Clara County.
        The tool was built to support the company’s expansion strategy by identifying areas with a high concentration of their target demographic.
        The data and geographic boundaries were sourced from the <a href="https://gisdata-csj.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/9c03b6eb70e14284b903460de164aba1_549/explore" target="_blank">City of San Jose</a>.
        Click the map to explore it fully.
